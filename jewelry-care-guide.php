                        While our 14k solid gold pieces are crafted to keep up with your everyday moments, we recommend
                        removing them during intense activities or when heading to the beach or gym.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        At home, store your pieces in a secure jewelry box, your ÉVORA pouch, or a dedicated dish to
                        keep them protected and free from tangles.

                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        To keep your 14k jewelry looking its best, we recommend regularly using a soft microfiber cloth
                        to gently remove any residues, oils, and minor scratches that naturally develop with wear. This
                        simple step helps maintain the luster of your pieces over time.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        For a deeper clean, mix warm water with a small amount of mild dish soap (Dawn is a great
                        option). Soak your jewelry for a few minutes to loosen any dirt or oils, then use a soft
                        toothbrush to gently scrub, paying special attention to crevices and settings where buildup can
                        accumulate. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive materials, as they can damage the surface of
                        your jewelry.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        While regular cleaning at home will keep your pieces looking fresh, we recommend having your 14k
                        jewelry professionally cleaned at least once a year. A professional cleaning will not only
                        restore the shine but also ensure that any settings are secure and that your jewelry remains in
                        optimal condition for years to come.

                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        Keep your jewelry in pristine condition by avoiding contact with lotions, oils, perfumes, and
                        chlorine. These substances can dull your piece's natural luster, lead to unwanted buildup, and
                        compromise the integrity of stone over time. We recommend cleaning your pieces regularly and
                        storing them properly when not in use.

                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        Silver is more sensitive to tarnishing than gold is, but restoring its shine is quite simple.
                        Regularly polish silver pieces with a soft, non-abrasive cloth. Store silver jewelry in a cool,
                        dry place, away from direct sunlight and humidity. You can use anti-tarnish pouches or jewelry
                        boxes lined with tarnish-resistant fabric to prevent tarnishing.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-xs text-primary leading-relaxed">
                        Sterling silver oxidizes in water, and we recommend removing your silver jewelry before
                        swimming, showering, or exercising. Avoid direct contact with household chemicals, perfumes,
                        lotions, and hairspray. You can use a mild silver cleaning solution or a mixture of mild soap
                        and water to gently clean pieces. Be sure to rinse thoroughly and dry with a soft cloth.

                        Diamonds are exceptionally durable but still require proper care to preserve their brilliance.
                        Remove diamond jewelry during physical activities to prevent damage, and store it separately
                        from other pieces to avoid scratching. Your ÉVORA pouch is perfect for keeping your diamonds
                        secure. With the right care, your diamonds will continue to shine for generations.

                        Herringbone chains, such as the Carter, Kennedy, and Kismet, should always be stored flat to
                        prevent twisting or bending. Handle carefully when putting them on or taking them off to
                        maintain their structure.

                        Dainty chains, like the Dear Kaia Necklace, Micro Rolo Chain, and Diamond Cut Rolo Chain should

                        Many of our bracelets are delicate and require special care. For example, the Cobra Chain

                        As with all of our pieces, store bracelets carefully—coiled in an ÉVORA pouch. We recommend
                        storing tennis bracelets in their boxes when not wearing. Be gentle with clasps when putting on
                        or removing them to maintain their integrity.

                        Dainty rings should be worn with care to avoid becoming bent out of shape. Rings with stones may
                        loosen over time, so store them properly and check for any loose stones regularly. Wear and tear
                        may cause natural scratching. To keep your rings in pristine condition, we recommend
                        professional polishing from a jeweler periodically.
