## Security Considerations

### Production Deployment

## Customization

### Adding New Categories
1. Update the category options in `admin/product-manager.php`
2. Add corresponding filter buttons in `bestsellers.php`
3. Update category display logic in `includes/product-functions.php`

### Styling
- The system uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom styles are in `assets/css/styles.css`
- Status badges can be customized in `includes/product-functions.php`

### Status Badges
Modify the `getStatusBadge()` function in `includes/product-functions.php` to change badge styling.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Images Not Uploading**: Check directory permissions
2. **Database Connection**: Verify database credentials
3. **Products Not Showing**: Ensure products are marked as active
